#  Advanced reporting and data segmentation

AnyTrack will report all conversion events to Google Analytics so you can filter, query, segment your data using the most advanced reporting and data segmentation features provided by Google Analytics.

Since AnyTrack uses the Google Analytics Client ID (the cookie set by Google Analytics), to attribute the conversions, Google Analytics will automatically attribute your conversion events according to their attribution models and rules.

As such, once the conversion has been sent to Google Analytics, you will have the ability to query any Google Analytics reports and see the data accordingly.
